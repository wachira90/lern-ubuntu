This error suggests that the Open vSwitch service is not running on your Ubuntu 22.04 system running in Hyper-V. Open vSwitch is a multilayer virtual switch often used in virtualized environments. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. First, check the status of the ovsdb-server service:

```
sudo systemctl status ovsdb-server.service
```

2. If the service is not running, try starting it:

```
sudo systemctl start ovsdb-server.service
```

3. If the service fails to start, you can check the logs for more information:

```
sudo journalctl -u ovsdb-server.service
```

4. Ensure that Open vSwitch is installed properly. If not, install it:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch
```

5. After installation or if it was already installed, enable the service to start on boot:

```
sudo systemctl enable ovsdb-server.service
```

6. Restart the Open vSwitch service:

```
sudo systemctl restart openvswitch-switch.service
```

7. If you're still experiencing issues, you may need to check if there are any conflicts with Hyper-V's network settings. Ensure that the virtual switch in Hyper-V is configured correctly for your Ubuntu VM.

8. In some cases, you may need to update or reinstall the Hyper-V integration services on your Ubuntu guest:

```
sudo apt install linux-azure
```

After performing these steps, reboot your Ubuntu VM and check if the error persists.

If you continue to face issues, you may need to investigate further by checking system logs or consulting Hyper-V and Ubuntu documentation for specific compatibility notes.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
